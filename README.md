A simple department store CLI mock-up. 

## Customer

A customer is provided a catalog table of all current in-stock items. Each item includes an _id_, _product name_, and _price_. The customer then has the option of selecting a product by _id_ as well as desired quantity. If the desired quantity doesn't exceed the in-stock quantity the database will reflect the change in stock.
