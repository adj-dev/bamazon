## Customer

![customer-gif](resources/customer.gif)

A customer is provided a catalog table of all current in-stock items. Each item includes an _id_, _product name_, and _price_. The customer then has the option of selecting a product by _id_ as well as desired quantity. If the desired quantity doesn't exceed the in-stock quantity the database will reflect the change in stock. 

## Manager

The manager app has much more functionality, including the ability to add inventory and new products.
